Data Centers in Georgia: Environmental Justice Implications for Communities of Color in DeKalb County

Affordability | Land-Use Conflicts | Transparency

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**BACKGROUND DATA**

Water Operating capability at 100% capacity (combined Georgia data centers) [1]
- Low estimate: 16,781 M gal/year  
- High estimate: 34,957 M gal/year  

Average U.S. per-capita water use: 82 gallons/day (USGS, 2015)
- Low end: Data centers use enough water each year to sustain 112,107 people for 5 years. 
- High end: Data centers use enough water each year to sustain 233,516 people for 5 years

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**ENERGY IMPACT (IN-USE AND PLANNED)**

Total estimated demand: 8,700 MW

- Georgia housing units: 4.6 million (Census, 2024)  
--Georgia Power Company estimates: 1 MW per 450 homes (over an hour) 
--At full capability, 8,700 MW could supply approximately 3.9 million homes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

Water Infrastructure  
- Cooling demands, water shortages, and strain on an aging water system.

Residential Areas  
- Noise pollution, increased traffic, and air emissions associated with diesel backup generators.

Greenbelts  
- Conley Creek and associated watershed.  
- Potential water use conflicts.  
- Potential wildlife disturbance from noise.  
- Potential downstream impacts to the larger watershed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**LEGISLATIVE CONTEXT**

Senate Bill 34 (SB 34)  
- Prohibits passing data center energy costs to residential customers.  
--Awaiting vote.

Proposal  
- Would require data centers to cover a greater share of operational costs.  
--Did not reach the legislative floor.

House Bill 1192 (HB 1192)  
- Suspended tax incentives for data centers.  
Passed by legislature; vetoed by Governor Kemp.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**IN-HOUSE (ULGA) RECOMMENDATIONS**

- Environmental Justice review requirements.  
- Siting restrictions.  
- Transparency and oversight through Development of Regional Impact (DRI) review.  
- Utility and water-use protections.  
- Community Benefits Agreements (CBAs).  
- State-level Environmental Justice oversight board.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**CONCLUSION**

Statutory safeguards modeled on best practices from other states are required to ensure technological growth does not impose disproportionate environmental and economic burdens on vulnerable populations.

Comparative state action plans reviewed:  
Virginia, Pennsylvania, California, New York.

**COMMENTS**

1. Greenbelts  
“[[Greenbelt]]” is referenced without definition - Please clarify functional meaning. 
- There may be a potential linkage to [[Watershed/River]] protections. 
- 
	- **Wetland**: Filter H2O, flood and erosion control, critical habitat, carbon storage
	- **Rivers and Streams**: Clean drinking water, wildlife habitat, recreation, downstream affects
	- **Wildlife Impacts**: Potential [[spillover effects]] to wildlife from noise pollution or other identifiable [[point source]] stressors.

1. **Clean Water Act (CWA, 1971)** [2]
Notes: Protection of waters connected to navigable waters in coherence with point source pollution
- Restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters (Sec. 101)
- Effluent (Wastewater Discharge) Limitations (Sec. 301)
-  Thermal Discharge (Sec. 316)

2. Clean Air Act (CAA)
Emission Regulation

3. Energy Act (2020)
Energy Efficiency of Data Centers

4. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)  
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and regulatory review requirements.
- Will need to research the criteria

5. Colony Creek, South River Watershed, and Navigable Waters  
*(Outflow to the Atlantic Ocean at Darien)*

- **Wetland Extent:** 142.31 acres  
- **Habitat Type:** Freshwater Forested/Shrub Wetland  
- **Cowardin Classification:** **PFO1A**

**STATEMENT**

- Starting looking at protecting the land as a system and humans may be enriched (de facto) 
	- Water Evaporation [[Atmospheric Impacts]] - Heat loss to the atmosphere 
	- Water Discharge: [[Blowdown]] - Draining of concentrated "grey/black" water
--Rights of Rivers
